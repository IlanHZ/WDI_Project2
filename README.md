An app to help seniors benefiting from all the advantages of cohabitation using Sinatra,Google Maps, Bcrypt, Bower and Jquery.

<h3>How it works: </h3>
Third Act was designed to help seniors finding either the perfect senior to come live with them,
or to help them finding another senior with a property where there would be happy to live in.

Therefore, depending on what the user is looking for, he can choose to go on the map showing all the available properties by clicking on
"I want to find a property", or to access the list of all potential roommate by clicking on "I want to find a roommate". 

If the user is looking for a property to share, he can directly click on a property on the map that interests him to access more informations.
He will be redirected the property profile which is linked to the owner's profile. If the user is interested, he has the possibility to "get in touch" with the owner. 
He can choose to get in touch directly through an internal messaging system in the app or to use phone / email.

If the user owns a property and want to find someone to share it with him, he can immediately access a list of all the potential roommates registerd on the website.
Then, he can see the user's full profile and choose to get in touch with him if he want to.

Having chosen to find a roommate also means that the user should "share your property" with the rest of the user. 
To share his property, the user has two options:
  - He can access the form from the map by clicking on "add a property" 
  - Or through the "share your property" button on the top right of the page.
